## Repo Rules

- Do not ask whether to create a git commit or push after making changes.
- When the user says "commit and push", run the necessary git commands (including `git add`, `git status`, `git commit`, `git push`) without further confirmation and use a detailed commit message that summarizes all changes since the last commit.
